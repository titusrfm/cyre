# Project: Cyre (final proect)

About:
- Designed with Discord.py. Cyre is designed as a multi-purpose bot. Features of the bot include moderation tools, user interaction, built-in games, and many other utilities.

- Cyre is currently undergoing production and has very limited use at the moment.

- Future features: built-in games, leveling system, moderation tools, currency

Installation:
- Be sure to have a discord server already created. (Preferably one that you own)

- In order to make a copy of this bot, you must head over to the Discord Developer website and head over to your Applications

- There you can create a new application

- Upon creating the application, head over to the "Bot" tab on the left directory and click "Add Bot"

- From there you can name your bot, choose the intents you want to allow and choose whether you want your bot to be open to the public

- Once you finish, you must head back to the left directory and click on "OAuth2" and it will bring up a menu where you will click on "URL Generator"

- In "URL Generator" you must click "bot" and choose all the permissions you want. (Choosing Administar will allow all permissions and make this step faster)

- Copy the url on the bottom and open up a new tab. Paste that URL and select the server you want your discord bot to be a part of. Allow the permissions asked.

- Head over to your server and it should now be a part of your server.

- In order to use this bot, you must head into terminal and locate where the file for the code is. Upon finding the location, the command "python3 <filename>.py" will activate the bot.

- Have fun experimenting!
